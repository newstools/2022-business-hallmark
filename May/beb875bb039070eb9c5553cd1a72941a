OKEY ONYENWEAKU Contrary to subdued expectations in many quarters, several Nigerian banks have posted strong earnings in the first quarter 2022. These banks include Zenith Bank, GTCO, UBA, FBNH, Fidelity Bank, FCMB, Stanbic IBTC, Union Bank among others. In this regard, the general turbulence witnessed in the wobbling economy, occasioned by the Russia/Ukraine war, high inflation, high AMCON/ NDIC fees, heightened insecurity and low investment could not deter the DMBs.
Zenith Banks earnings up 22% to N191.5bn in Q1 2022 It announced its unaudited results for the first quarter ended 31st March 2022, with an impressive 22 percent growth in Gross Earnings from N157.3 billion reported in Q1 2021 to N191.5 billion in Q1 2022. From the unaudited statement of account presented to the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) on Thursday, 28th April 2022, the strong double-digit growth in the topline culminated in an increase in the bottom line, as the Group recorded an 11% Year-on-Year (YoY) increase in profit before tax, growing from N61.02 billion in Q1 2021 to N67.99 billion in Q1 2022. Profit after tax also grew by 10%, from N53.06 billion to N58.19 billion over the same period. The growth in the topline arose from both interest income and non-interest income. Interest income grew by 25%, from N101.12 billion in Q1 2021 to N126.38 billion in Q1 2022, while non-interest income grew by 12%, from N51.20 billion to N57.23 billion. The growth in interest income and non-interest income arose from the combined effects of an improvement in interest income on loans and advances (as risk assets continue to grow and pricing is gradually improving) and an improvement in non-interest income as the Bank continues to deploy its retail strategy, thereby acquiring more customers and expanding its electronic banking income from the increased volume of transactions across all its channels. Total assets grew by 9% from N9.45 trillion to N10.32 trillion in 2022, mainly driven by growth in customers deposits. Customer deposits grew by 12%, from N6.47 trillion in December 2021 to N7.25 trillion in March 2022. Savings account balance, which is solely retail grew by over N68 billion and is a validation of the robust customer acquisition strategy and versatile electronic platforms and digital channels. Loans and advances also grew by 6%, from N3.5 trillion in December 2021 to N3.7 trillion in March 2022, boosting the Groups interest income and displaying the Groups appetite for high-yielding risk assets creation. This development also helped to boost the net interest margin (NIM), as it improved from 6.0% in March 2021 to 7.3% in the current period, while the capital adequacy ratio improved slightly from 21.1% to 22.1%. Going into the remainder of 2022, the Group is likely going to focus on sustainable growth across all its business segments and deploy technology platforms and digital assets intuitively to serve its various customers needs to deliver enhanced returns to its stakeholders.

UBAs Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Mr Kennedy Uzoka, explained that despite the myriad of economic challenges on the global front which shaped the first three months of the year, the banks business model continued to show resilience. These challenges among others, he noted include the ongoing crisis between Russia and Ukraine that has resulted in a huge supply shock, pushing up commodity prices; and the hike in the interest rates in most advanced countries aimed at tackling spiralling inflation, sparking capital flow reversal from emerging and frontier markets. Notwithstanding these developments, we were able to leverage gains from our large customer base and vast geographical spread to bolster earnings.

Emphasising the banks commitment to sustain value for its shareholders in the 2022 financial year, the GMD said, With strategies in place to further increase revenue and drive cost lower, we are determined to achieve our Cost-to-Income ratio target of below 60.0% by year-end; and for 2022, we are committed to consolidating on the strong start, surpassing our goals and targets, as we look forward to delivering stronger returns to our esteemed shareholders. Breaking down the figures, UBAs Group Chief Finance Officer(GCFO), Ugo Nwaghodoh, said, Our Q122 financial numbers show we are off with a good start. Particularly, 1 am pleased with how we deployed our balance sheet in the period to grow revenues and increase our market share in a number of West African markets. Driven majorly by interest from customer loans and our investments in long-dated instruments, we grew interest income by an unprecedented quarterly rate of 15 percent to N125.1 billion. We drove down our annualized cost of funds by 11 basis points to 2.1%. This was achieved despite the uptick in the interest rate environment in the period, the GCFO said. He expressed confidence that the bank will meet and surpass its target for the remaining three quarters of the year, adding that We remain well-capitalized and liquid to fulfil our growth strategy, take up opportunities in key sectors, whilst navigating impending macroeconomic headwinds.
