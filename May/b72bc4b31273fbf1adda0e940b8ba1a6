Goodluck Jonathan, Nigeria’s former president, is missing on the list of 24 presidential hopefuls listed by the All Progressives Congress (APC) for screening. A northern coalition had bought the ruling party’s presidential nomination forms for the former president who was also declared eligible to contest for president by a federal high court in Bayelsa State last week. However, despite ongoing speculations on him contesting, the former president is still yet to make any definitive statement on if he will seek a return bid. Felix Morka, APC spokesman, had said 28 presidential forms were purchased, but three persons — Chris Ngige, minister of labour; Timipre Sylva, minister of state for petroleum: and Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) — did not submit their forms. A form was also purchased for Akinwumi Adesina, president of the African Development Bank (AfDB), but he had said he was not interested in contesting.
