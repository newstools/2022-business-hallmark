President Muhammadu Buhari has promised criminals responsible for the gruesome murder of pregnant northern woman, identified as Fatima, along with her four children that they will face tough response from the security forces. A statement from Garba Shehu, Buhari’s senior special assistant on Media and Publicity, warned the perpetrators of the dastardly act to expect tough response from the security forces. He, however, cautioned against any knee-jerk reactions, the creation of panic, disruption of lives and livelihoods, or even retaliatory violence following the viral videos of the alleged killings of non-indigenes by the Eastern Security Network (ESN) and its ‘mother terrorist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).’ The President said while expert agencies are now verifying the factuality and veracity of the claims that accompany the horrid pictures being circulated, he called on all citizens to avoid hasty steps or conclusions that could exacerbate the situation, and on the contrary keep to a line of conduct that will help the law to take its proper course. He also cautioned the public against the indiscriminate sharing of posts on social media so as to deny vested interests who seek to divide the country and create disturbance the chance to do so. In the issuance of his very strong condemnation of these “wild, barbarous and wanton killings of innocent people” in the South-East as well as the other parts of the country, which he described as “deeply distressing,” President Buhari warned that perpetrators will face tough response from the security forces.
