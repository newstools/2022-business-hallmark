UBAs Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Mr Kennedy Uzoka, explained that despite the myriad of economic challenges on the global front which shaped the first three months of the year, the banks business model continued to show resilience. These challenges among others, he noted include the ongoing crisis between Russia and Ukraine that has resulted in a huge supply shock, pushing up commodity prices; and the hike in the interest rates in most advanced countries aimed at tackling spiralling inflation, which has however sparked capital flow reversal from emerging and frontier markets. Notwithstanding these developments, we were able to leverage gains from our large customer base and vast geographical spread to bolster earnings. We recorded double-digit growth of 18 percent in our gross earnings to N183.9 billion, with our Nigerian operation raking in 65 percent of the revenue while our operations in other countries accounted for the remainder, showing the diversity in our operations, Uzoka said. The GMD pointed out that amid the Great Resignation wave that has seen a record number of employees across the globe quit their jobs, disrupting the performance of many businesses, UBA, in the last quarter of 2021, thoughtfully reviewed upwards, the salaries of its staff as part of broad measures to retain talents, adding, We believe our staff is part of our success story with their welfare as a top priority.

The lender (Company) has remained formidable in the midst of all odds. In fact, the previous years its strong performances have also provided a sturdy base for the vigour and strength which the lender has displayed. Analysts are bullish on the bank which has shown vigour and promise. One significant thing about UBA is that it has long left its contemporaries behind and remained a leader. UBA has paid dividend in 2021. I will take it from the historical perspective. UBA was one of the three old dominant banks and among them, I mean Union Bank and First bank have been seriously troubled to the point that they fallen down the pecking order. Union Bank and First Bank rubbing shoulders with the tire 2 and 3 banks . But UBA has remained entrenched as a tier 1 bank. That shows that the bank is resolute and has continued to grow from strength to strength. For several years it has been bedeviled by the kind of challenges that have burdened the other banks. Though it has its own internal problems. But it has been able to weather the storm. It has been able to do that because of the kind of re-invigorated leadership that one person has brought to the table and that is Tony Elumelu. Tony has kept that pedigree and has been able consolidate the bank, making a very vibrant and competitive brand. Then their cross border expansion has added huge value to the bank. The bank is now entrenched in the international arena, I think for that bank the sky is its limit, especially now that there is AFCTA, the African continental trade area which will push most African countries to trade more among themselves. Most of those transactions will run through banks and UBA is one of the banks that is positioned to benefit from that trade, said Adonri  Key highlights of its results § The Nigerian lender earned N125.08 billion from its lending business as Interest income grew by 15.18% from N108.59 billion. § Despite a 223% spike in loan losses, net operating income after impairments still appreciated by 16.33% to stand at N121.71 billion. § The bank, however, grew its net income from fees and commission rising 19.30% to N24.30 billion year on year. § . § The bank also made Income from the disposal of property, dividends, rental, and cash handling, which raked in a total of N1.76 billion. § The banks Electronic banking income raked in N15.11 billion, representing a 21.04% increase from N12.48 million in Q1 2021, indicating that the bank has efficiently utilized its use of electronic banking channels to deliver financial services to its consumers. § Trade transactions income for the Q1 2022 period grew by 109.19% from N7.42 billion in the corresponding period of 2021 to N3.55 billion. § In addition, the bank also grew its deposits from customers by 4.47% to N6.65 trillion while its total assets are now N8.89 trillion.
