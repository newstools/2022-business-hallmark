A Federal High Court sitting in Osogbo, the Osun State capital, has affirmed Senator Ademola Adeleke as the authentic candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the July 16 governorship election in the state. Justice Nathaniel Emmanuel made the declaration on Wednesday while delivering a ruling in a suit filed by a factional candidate of the PDP, Prince Dotun Babayemi. Babayemi has asked the court to be recognised as the authentic candidate of the Party following the parallel primaries held on March 9.
