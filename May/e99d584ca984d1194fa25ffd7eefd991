Former Lagos State governor and presidential hopeful, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, demonstrated vast knowledge before the All Progressives Congress (APC) screening panel on Monday, Bayo Onanuga, his media aide has said. The ruling party’s screening committee, chaired by John Oyegun, former chairman of the party, concluded the first phase of the exercise on Monday night. Twelve aspirants were screened on Monday, and the remaining 11 are scheduled for the exercise on Tuesday. There had concerns in the Tinubu camp over the choice of Oyegun as head of the screening panel, given that both men have been at loggerheads in the recent past, with the former Lagos governor supposedly being instrumental to Oyegun’s eventual removal at APC chairman in 2018. But according Onanuga, spokesman of the Tinubu campaign organisation, when he appeared before the panel, the former Lagos governor highlighted his achievements and why he is fit to be president and showed brilliance. “Tinubu impressed the panel during the screening process with the way and manner he answered and provided insight into many of the questions asked,” the statement said “Some of the questions bordered on his upbringing, educational and professional background. He confidently told the panel why he is qualified to fly the flag of APC as its presidential candidate. “He cited his success as governor of Lagos State, his raising the internal revenue generation of the state from a paltry N600M monthly, which has now grown to N51Billion today. “He also cited his invitation to Enron to begin the first state-backed power generation in Nigeria and how Nigeria will need to take the power transmission lines as a highway. “Tinubu in his answers demonstrated vast knowledge in economic management and perfect understanding of Nigeria’s political economy. “The screening committee expressed satisfaction with Tinubu’s knowledge of the economy and sociopolitical issues that are affecting the country.”
