The building housing the Federal Ministry of Finance located in the Central Area of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, caught fire in the early hours of Wednesday. Federal Fire Service and other concerned agencies are currently on ground trying to salvage the situation. The ministry has explained, however, that it’s not a fire incident as being widely reported, but an incident involving an isolated battery pack. “The Federal Ministry of Finance HQ is not on fire as reported on social media. Rather, there was an incident on the corridor in the basement involving an isolated battery Pack. It was quickly put out by the security personnel on duty.
