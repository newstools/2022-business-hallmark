Will Smith, American actor, won the Best Actor award at the 94th Academy Awards held at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood on Sunday night. He got his award shortly after slapping a Chris Rock, comedian, who made a joke about Jada Pinkett, his wife, while presenting a different award. The event had a host for the first time in four years — with Amy Schumer, Regina Hall, and Wanda Sykes co-hosting the event. ‘CODA’, the English-language remake of the 2014 French film La Famille Bélier, won all three awards it was nominated for. This includes the ‘Best Picture’ category and a historic win for Troy Kotsur, who won for ‘Best Supporting Actor’ — becoming the first deaf man to win an Academy Award for acting. Jane Campion won the ‘Best Director’ category for her role in ‘The Power of the Dog’ while Jessica Chastain secured her first Oscar for her performance in ‘The Eyes of Tammy Faye’.
