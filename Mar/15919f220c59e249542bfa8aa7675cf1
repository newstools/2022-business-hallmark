Nigeria’s president, Muhammadu Buhari has joined the Obasi family, Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) and Nigeria Guild of Editors (NGE) in paying tribute to the late Prince Emeka Obasi, publisher of Business Hallmark Newspaper. In a condolence message by his media aide, Mr Femi Adesina, on Thursday in Abuja, the president also commiserated with friends and professional colleagues, especially members of the Newspaper Proprietors Association of Nigeria (NPAN) over the sad loss of the veteran journalist and administrator. Buhari affirmed that Obasi, who served as Commissioner for Information in Abia, lived a patriotic life, contributing to the growth of the nation and welfare of citizens. He noted that the deceased had set up legacies like the Public Policy Research and Analysis Centre (PPRAC), which organises the annual Zik Prize in Leadership Awards. The president prayed that God would accept the soul of the departed and comfort all those mourning him.
