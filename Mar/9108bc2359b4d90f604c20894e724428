Wife of the Willie Obiano, the immediate past governor of Anambra State, Mrs. Ebelechukwu Obiano, on Thursday, slapped Mrs Bianca Ojukwu, wife of late Chief Emeka Ojukwu at the inauguration ceremony of the state’s new governor, Charles Soludo. According to a report by a News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) correspondent who was at the scene of the event, the incident occurred immediately after Soludo took his oath of office. NAN reports that dignitaries including Ex-Gov Obiano were already seated when Mrs Obiano stepped in and moved to the front row where the widow of Dim Odumegwu Ojukwu was seated and slapped her. The action drew the attention of security agents and some personalities who pulled Mrs Obiano off the hold of Bianca who was visibly shocked at the action. Mrs Obiano was later taken away and shortly afterwards, her husband left the venue since the incident happened after the new governor had been sworn in. There’s been bad blood between the Obianos and Mrs. Ojukwu.
