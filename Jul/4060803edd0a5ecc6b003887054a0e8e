OBINNA EZUGWU Dr. Alex Otti, former bank CEO and governorship candidate of the Labour Party for Abia State governorship election, has assured the people that their talents will be put to good use in the quest to reclaim the state. Dr. Otti who expressed pride in the enthusiasm of the people and their desire for change, noted that he’s humbled the level of support he has received. The renowned economist who is widely believed to be the rightful winner of the state’s governorship election in 2015, restated his resolve to change Abia for the better. “I am so proud of the enthusiasm with which our youths, most especially in Abia state are approaching the 2023 election,” Otti wrote via his twitter account after a rally in the state. “Humbled by your desire to lead this change, I promise that your talents will be put to good use in this quest of reclaiming our dear state.” In an earlier tweet, the Labour Party candidate emphasized that Abia is not cursed, as it has both human and material resources to excel. According to him, the problem of the state is leadership, and time has come to get the leadership right. “Abia state is not cursed. We are blessed with human resource to compete with the best,” he said. ‘Fertile lands to feed our people, viable industries that can serve the world, and generate enough revenue to meet our needs. Our problem is bad leadership. But this time, we must get it right.”
