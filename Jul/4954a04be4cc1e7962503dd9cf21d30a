Shinzo Abe, Japan’s former prime minister, has reportedly died after he was shot at a political campaign event. Mr Abe was shot at twice while he was giving a speech in the southern city of Nara on Friday morning. He immediately collapsed and was rushed to the nearest hospital. Pictures taken at the scene showed him bleeding. Security officials at the scene tackled the gunman, and the 41-year-old suspect is now in police custody. In an emotional press conference a few hours later, prime minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that Mr Abe was in a “very grave condition”. “Currently doctors are doing everything they can,” said Mr Kishida who appeared to be holding back tears, adding that he was “praying from his heart” that Mr Abe would survive. He also condemned the attack, saying: “It is barbaric and malicious and it cannot be tolerated.” The Fire and Disaster Management Agency had confirmed that Mr Abe had a bullet wound on the right of his neck, and also suffered subcutaneous bleeding under the left part of his chest.
