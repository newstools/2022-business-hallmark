The national oil firm said, “President Muhammadu Buhari is on a state visit to Portugal for the second United Nations Ocean Conference. “On the sidelines of the event, President Muhammadu Buhari is leading a high-level Nigerian business delegation to the Nigeria-Portugal Business & Trade Forum. “On the President’s delegation is the CEO NNPC Ltd, Mallam Mele Kyari, who highlighted the age-long energy partnership between the two countries, stressing that Nigeria supplies 70 per cent of energy imports to the European nation.” The tweet further quoted the NNPC boss as saying, “This year alone, we have sold over a billion dollar worth of natural gas to Portugal.” Kyari also noted that there were ample opportunities to grow energy supply to Portugal.
