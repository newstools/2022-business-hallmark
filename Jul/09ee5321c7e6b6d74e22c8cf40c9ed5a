Funke Akindele, Nollywood actress, has been named the running mate to Olajide Adediran, popularly called Jandor, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate of Lagos State. The actress confirmed her deputy governorship candidacy in a video on her verified Instagram page on Tuesday. She also posted campaign pictures of himself and Jandor on her twitter account. In the video she posted on Tuesday, she revealed her reasons for becoming a running mate. She said, “I saw it as an opportunity to help liberate and improve the wellbeing of our people, particularly the deprived youth, women and the girl child. “My decision is not just to accept this huge responsibility but to also work tirelessly and complement Jandor’s burning desire to see our dear Lagos live up to its full potentials.” Meanwhile, when she said her name at the end of the video, the Ikorodu-born indigene of Lagos didn’t include her husband’s name, Bello. This comes two weeks after her husband, Abdulrasheed Bello, popularly known as JJC Skillz, announced that they have gone their separate ways. Bello, who confirmed the separation in an Instagram post on July 1, said things had not been going well between him and the actress in the last two years, adding that all efforts expended on reconciling their differences had proved abortive. The actress, however, has remained silent on her separation from her husband as she is yet to address Bello’s claims.
