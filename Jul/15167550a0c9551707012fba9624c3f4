Not less than 15 chieftains of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Kaduna State, on Thursday, dumped the party, citing a lack of internal democracy. One of those who decamped revealed that about 500 members are joining them following unresolved matters in the state chapter of the party. The latest party chieftains, who left the party on Thursday, July 21, 2022 were: Mallam Audu Bode, Alh. Shuabu Ahmed, Hon. Habila Latu, Boniface Ubandoma, Mr. Yakubu Simon, Jashua Peter, Camio Bitrus, Patrick Paul (Pato), Mr. Samuel Wyah, Zaka Makoshi, Jonathan Fedelix, Barnabas Samuel (Barry), Shua’ibu Yusuf, Alexander Danladi (Lulu), Samuel Ibrahim. The APC Legal Adviser in Jema’a Local Government Area, Hon. Ibrahim Samuel, in a letter addressed to his Ward Chairman, said, “His decision to dump the party was based on the internal crises of the party. Samuel and Hon. Ibrahim Samuel (Oganto) and issued to newsmen in Kaduna on Thursday, the decampees lamented that the names that emanated during the last party congress were entirely different from the ones brought to be used for the primaries. The different names, they claimed, were responsible for the present court case between Sen. Uba Sani and Sha’aban. “Another reason was that the State House of Assembly party primaries has come and gone but certainly not without some avoidable challenges. It is only logical and ideal that after every contest all the aspirants that lost in the contest are brought together for genuine reconciliation with the flag bearer. Last month, instead of calling for reconciliation, the party stakeholders of our local government met at Kaduna under the guise of reconciliation, but the meeting turned out issuing warnings and threats to those that lost in the last primaries should any of them be caught in any anti-party activity in the forthcoming election.”
