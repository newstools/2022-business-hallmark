The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has suspended Dana Airlines’ air transport licence (ATL) and air operator certificate (AOC) indefinitely. NCAA announced the suspension on Wednesday in a statement signed by its director general, Musa Nuhu. The authority said it suspended the operating licences after “discovering that the airline is no longer in a position to meet its financial obligations and to conduct safe flight operations”. NCAA said the suspension takes effect from midnight on Wednesday, July 20, 2022. The statement partly read, “The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has suspended Dana Airlines’Air Transport Licence (ATL) and Air Operator Certificate (AOC) indefinitely, with effect from midnight of Wednesday,20th July, 2022 “The suspension was made pursuant to Section 35(2), 3(b), and (4) of the Civil Aviation Act, 2006 and Part 1.3.3.3(a)(1) of the Nigeria Civil Aviation Regulations (http://Nig.CARs), 2015. “The decision is the outcome of a financial and economic health audit carried out on the airline by the authority, and the findings of an investigation conducted on the airline’s flight operations recently, which revealed that Dana Airlines is no longer in a position to meet its financial obligations and to conduct safe flight operations. “The NCAA acknowledges the negative effect this preemptive decision will have on the Airline’s passengers and the travelling public and seeks their understanding, as the safety of flight operations takes priority over all other considerations.” This year, the airline has reported two incidents with its aircraft.
