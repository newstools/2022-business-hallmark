Members of 27 All Progressives Congress (APC) youth groups and the National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) have rejected the choice of Senator Kashim Shettima as the ivice presidential candidate of the party.

Specifically, they demanded the immediate replacement of Senator Kashim Shettima with Dr. Ibrahim Dauda (El-Dabi) as the APC vice presidential candidate before Friday’s deadline by the Independent National Electoral Commission for the substitution of party candidates for the 2023 general elections.

We are willing to participate in politics and function appropriately in governance. We remain resolute on this ONLY.”
