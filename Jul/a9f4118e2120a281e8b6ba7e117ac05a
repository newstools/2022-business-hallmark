Professor Pat Utomi, a political economist, has argued that the Labour Party has a better structure than the APC and PDP, Prof Utomi, a member of the Labour Party stated this when he appeared as a guest on Channels Television’s Politics Today on Tuesday. He expressed confidence that his party will coast to victory in the 2023 presidential election, which is barely seven months away. “Labour Party has a super structure, much better than the structures APC and the PDP have,” he said. “The Labour Party is built around the labour movement and a college of civil society organisations.” Utomi noted that the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC) have political commissions in every state of the federation. He stated that the party will mobilise people during the forthcoming polls to ensure that every polling booth is covered. Utomi, however, decried a situation whereby those in public office would steal money to rig elections, a situation people have mistaken to be political structures. He explained that the scenario whereby politicians bribe their way during elections is changing as the people want a different narrative. “With the structure that we have, I am guaranteeing that on the election day, in every polling station in this country, there are at least 15 people who are standing up for the third force to support the Labour party candidate,” he said. On the possibility of a merger with other parties, the LP chieftain stated that talks are ongoing with several political parties, although he did not disclose any specific one. When asked why he’s confident of LP’s victory, he berated the performance of both APC and PDP that have ruled Nigeria. Noting that they have made Africa’s most populous nation bankrupt through excessive borrowings, Utomi insisted that Nigerians demand new confidence from fresh leadership.
