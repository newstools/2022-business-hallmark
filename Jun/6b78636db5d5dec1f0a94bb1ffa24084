Tottenham are reportedly preparing to outbid Arsenal for Napoli striker, Victor Osimhen. The 23-year-old has scored 28 goals in 62 appearances since joining the Italian outfit from Lille for £67.5million in 2020. The Gunners had an initial bid of £51million rejected by the Serie A side earlier this week as they eye a replacement for Alexandre Lacazette. Reports have stated Mikel Arteta’s men are now considering a club record £86m bid to get a deal over the line. Man Utd have also been linked with a move for the Nigerian. However, according to journalist Lorenzo Amuso, Spurs could well get there ahead of them both. Antonio Conte’s side are able to offer Osimhen Champions League football next season. Amuso told Calcio Mercato: “Conte, thanks to the Champions League qualification, has obtained great guarantees on the transfer market, so we can expect really great things from Tottenham. “Among the names, there is Osimhen of Napoli. “Tottenham is not the only club that has taken an interest. Arsenal have already presented a €60m offer, rejected by [Aurelio] De Laurentiis [Napoli’s owner].”
