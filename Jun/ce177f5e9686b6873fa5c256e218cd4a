Yahaya Abdullahi, Senate majority leader, has dumped the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kebbi State. Yahaya’s special adviser on media and publicity Muhammad Jamil Gulma confirmed the defection. “Senate Leader Dr Yahaya Abdullahi will on Wednesday by 9 am leave Abuja for Kebbi and proceed to Kamba local government to formally declare for PDP and to possibly indicate his interest to contest his present seat,” he said. Dr Yahaya who participated in the APC’s Kebbi governorship primaries was reported to have scored Zero votes, an outcome which he had since rejected.
