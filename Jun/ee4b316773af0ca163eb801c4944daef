The National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), has directed the Facebook, Twitter Tik Tok, Google and other internet platforms to register Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) and appoint country representatives to Nigeria. The conditions are stated in the recently released Code of Practice for Interactive Computer Service Platforms/Internet Intermediaries (online platforms), as disclosed in a statement issued by NITDA on Monday. The statement read in part, “NITDA wishes to present to the public a Code of Practice for Interactive Computer Service Platforms/Internet Intermediaries for future review and input.” The Code of Practice was developed by NITDA alongside the Nigerian Communications Commission and National Broadcasting Commission,with input from platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Google, and Tik Tok. One of such conditions in the Code of Practice is that each online platform is required to have a country representative, who will interface with the Nigerian authorities. This means that Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Google, Tik Tok and other interactive online platforms are required to have country representatives. Other conditions include registering with the Corporate Affairs Commission as a legal entity, complying with tax obligations, and abide by regulatory and legal demands. The Code of Practice is aimed at safeguarding the fundamental human rights of Nigerians and non-Nigerians living in Nigeria, and regulating interactions on online platforms.
