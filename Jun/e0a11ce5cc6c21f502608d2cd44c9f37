According to him, our economic agenda has a comprehensive objective of providing a more hospitable environment for businesses to thrive. With thriving businesses, Atiku said, his administration would create jobs and wealth for Nigerian citizens. According to him, “And to achieve these, I have three guiding principles to go by: “Reaffirm the criticality of private-sector leadership and greater private sector participation in development; while repositioning the public sector to focus on its core responsibility of facilitation and enabling the appropriate legal and regulatory framework for rapid economic and social development. “Break government monopoly in all infrastructural sectors, including the refineries, rail transportation and power transmission and give private investors a larger role in funding and managing the sectors, thus emulating the benefits accrued in the oil and gas and telecom sectors. “Allow the market greater leverage in determining prices. This way we shall eliminate the persistent price distortions occasioned by current interventionist exchange rate management policy. Government intervention, where absolutely necessary, will be done responsibily and judiciously.”
