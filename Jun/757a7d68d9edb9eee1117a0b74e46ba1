Former Anambra State governor and presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, has said that the Spiritual Director of Adoration Ministry, Enugu, Father Ejike Mbaka, remains his priest and father in faith. Obi said this during an interview on the Voice of the People 90.3 FM monitored in Lagos. Mbaka had said that the former Anambra State governor cannot win next year’s general election because he is “stingy”. While speaking during one of his programmes last Wednesday, the cleric maintained that it would be impossible for Obi to become Nigeria’s president, adding that an old man president is better than a ‘stingy young man’. However, speaking during the radio interview, Obi said, “For me, Father Mbaka is an ordained priest of God and as a priest, he remains my priest. I will always respect and show my allegiance to the church. “Whatever he says, I will take it because he’s my father in faith. I respect him and he’s my brother.” Mbaka had received heavy bashing for the comment, which led to a ban on his ministry by the Enugu Catholic Diocese.
