Abdul Bello, popularly known as JJC Skillz, has disclosed that he has parted ways with his wife and Nollywood actress, Funke Akindele. The duo’s marriage has been problematic with rumours of their separation circulating a number of times in the past. Mr. Bello, has however, officially announced that they have separated. He made the announcement on his Instagram page on Wednesday. “Dear Friends and family I need to let you know that Funke and I have separated. While it lasted we shared a lot of things together and have created 2 beautiful children. The last two years have been extremely difficult for us,” he wrote. Bello further noted that the actress insisted he moved out of the house about three months ago. “I know I have tried my best to fix things but I believe it is beyond repair now. 3 months ago and at Funke’s insistence, I moved out of the house and apart from AMVCA have not been able to get Funke to sit down in an amicable manner to discuss the future of our relationship. I’m making this announcement so that the public is clear that we both are pursuing separate lives. We still have issues that need to be addressed such as the custody and wellbeing of our children which is paramount as well as business interests which need to be disentangled but I have no doubt that these will be resolved one way or the other. Mr Abdul Bello.”
