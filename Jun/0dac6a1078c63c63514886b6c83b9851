The state Commissioner for Internal Security and Humanitarian Affairs, Emmanuel Umar, confirmed the attack in a statement on Thursday but said the number of casualties were yet to be ascertained. He said, “Niger State Government wishes to confirm that on 29/6/2022 at about 1600hrs, based on a distress call received that bandits/terrorists invaded a mining site located at Ajata Aboki village via Erena Ward of Shiroro LGA and a joint security team were mobilized to the scene in response to the distress call.” Umar said while the terrorists were engaged by the joint security team, resulting in casualties from both sides. He added, “A yet-to-be ascertained number of workers in the mining site including four Chinese nationals were reported to have been abducted. “Security forces mobilized reinforcement for the manhunt of the remaining terrorists and rescue of the injured victims including security personnel that sustained varying degrees of injury have been taken to a government medical facility in the state for treatment. “While the Niger State Government commiserates with the heads of security agencies in the state and the families of the slain personnel, the state government assures that their sacrifices will not go in vain.” Umar said the state government acknowledged all the effort of the joint security operatives and that of the communities in the state towards taming the spate of insecurity in some parts of the state. A resident of the area however said  that about 11 people including seven mobile policemen attached to the mining site as security guards and six other civilian workers lost their lives in the attack.
