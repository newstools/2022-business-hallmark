While some media outlets (not Business Hallmark) reported that Abdulsalami fell down and broke his spine, others claimed he may have suffered stroke. According to sources, the ex-military head of state was rushed out of the country towards the end of May 2022 to receive medical treatment. The sources claimed he was first flown to Dubai in the United Arab Emirate for treatment but when his condition did not improved, he was flown to a specialist hospital in England.

Please, no cause for alarm”, the presidential spokesperson had stated via a short statement released on Monday.
