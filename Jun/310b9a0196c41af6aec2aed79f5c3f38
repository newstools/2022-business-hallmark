Nollywood actress, Chacha Eke-Faani’s husband, Austin Faani, has denied allegations of domestic violence levelled against him by his wife. Chacha announced the crash of her nine-year marriage to Austin via her Instagram page on Tuesday, stating that she did not want to “die or go inexplicably missing”. He wrote, “For the second time in two years, I am here again on social media boldly declaring that I am done with my marriage. “My long overdue/relentless stance on this is of course no news to Austin Faani, the doctors and my parents. If push comes to shove and suddenly I am incommunicado; my lawyers, the welfare department and the Nigeria Police Force have my testimonials in recorded video clips/statements set for public release on all social media apps and national newspapers.” But Austin Faani has taken to his Instagram page on Tuesday to debunk the rumours. According to him, he had never raised his hands to harm any woman, including his wife. “I am not a violent person. Personally I detest violence in any form. I have never raised my hand on any woman in my life, including my wife. “Everyone close to this case knows the absolute truth and it is not in my place to divulge it. The one person who started the talk will in due time continues to talk. Let light lead,” he wrote in the post.
