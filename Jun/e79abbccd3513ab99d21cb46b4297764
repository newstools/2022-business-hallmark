Father Ejike Mbaka, director of Adoration Ministry, Enugu Nigeria (AMEN), has withdrawn the statement he made against Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party and asked for forgiveness. Recall that the outspoken clergy had while addressing congregants at his adoration ground on Wednesday, described the former governor of Anambra State as a stingy man, noting that he will never be the president of Nigeria. The comments generated outrage across the country, with many, especially youth berating the priest. Amid the controversy, Mbaka in a statement on Friday, retracted and asked Obi’s supporters to forgive him. He said, “I am grateful to God for His unquantifiable and favorable blessings, miracles, love and life for the Adoration Ministry, Enugu, Nigeria. “I assure the people of God and Nigerians that I am praying for Good Governance and Good Leadership in this country and that God will give us leaders after His own Heart. “As it stands right now, it is obvious that Nigeria is passing through an indescribable insecurity, inestimable unemployment, massive corruption, heinous crimes and unbearable suffering engendered by bad leadership. I bear with my fellow country men and women in whatever we are passing through in this trying time. I call on the adorers and the entire people of God to join hands in praying that God will deliver us from the plans of the devil and its wicked agents. “I am a servant of God and my intention is not to malign His Excellency, Peter Obi’s image, but to pray for him. May God’s will be done in his life. I pray to God whom I serve to give our beloved people good and excellent leaders who will take care of them and lead them to the promised land. Anyone who God wishes to make our Leader is my choice. In this vein, I give my blessings to the supporters of His Excellency Peter Obi. In any way they feel offended by my utterances or however I was misunderstood by them, I ask for their understanding and forgiveness. As a servant of the Most High God, I pray that it shall be well with my people. I am an ardent supporter of Good Governance, Justice, Equity,Love and Godliness. “At this time our people are passing through the valleys of shadows of death(Ps23.4),I pray for peace , love and anything that will bring blessings and favour to our people and to our suffering teaming youths. I will always stand with you in all your ordeals. God will take care of you and bless you miraculously for me. “My intention is not to fight or malign Mr Obi. May God bless him and his good supporters. God’s will be done in his political endeavors(Mk.14:36) “The followers of Peter Obi are the same youths I am praying for,sacrificing for, fighting for , speaking for and working for their integral well being. What the youths are passing through and their conditions give me sleepless nights. It is for this reason that I yearn for good governance and worthy leaders that will take care of them. We are passing through indescribable ,unbearable and undeserved hardship in this country. I pray for Divine intervention. “I am not in any political party but I support good people and good governance. Any good person that God can give us is my choice candidate. I am a servant of God; For the sake of peace, I ask for forgiveness in any way I am misunderstood. And to Peter Obi himself, I ask God to bless him and manifest his will in his life. When God says Yes, who can say No? And when God says No, who can say Yes? I bless Peter Obi and pray for him. I bless my dear fellow Adorers and pray for them. I bless the people of God everywhere and I pray that it shall be well with you all. “For some Spiritual reasons, there will be no all night Adoration program today,17th June 2022.
