Maduka Okoye, Super Eagles goalkeeper, has explained that the desire to fulfil his childhood ambition made him join English side, Watford. Okoye linked up with the Hornets from Eredivisie club, Sparta Rotterdam but was loaned back to the club. The 22-year-old spent two years in Holland, having arrived in 2020 after severing ties with Bundesliga club, Fortuna Dusseldorf. The goalie was rated as one of the best shot-stoppers in the Dutch league despite playing for a modest club. “I grew up watching English football and it was always a dream to play in this country,” Okoye was quoted by Watford Observer. “It does still feel like it’s a bit of a dream even now, so I need a few weeks of being around the training ground to remind me that I’m here now and I’ve made the step to English football. “As a kid, it was English football I wanted to play in and now I’m going to put the work in to make that happen.”
