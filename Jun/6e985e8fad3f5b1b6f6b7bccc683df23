Commenting on the results, the Chief Financial Officer, AXA Mansard Insurance, Mrs Ngozi Ola-Israel, said, “We delivered double-digit revenue growth of 14 per cent YoY from N25.07bn to N28.64bn and 39 per cent YoY net income growth from 8.34bn to 11.57bn in the first quarter despite a challenging macroeconomic environment. “However, we also grew life and health businesses by 58 per cent and 24 per cent respectively while our P & C business dipped five per cent as a result of large unrenewable business written in 2021 and deliberate careful selection of risk in 2022. “The decline of 84 per cent and 85 per cent respectively in the PBT and PAT is largely driven by higher claims experienced in our health portfolio coupled with fair value losses and foreign exchange losses. “The core underlying earnings (excluding fair value gains/losses, capital gains/losses and foreign exchange movements) dipped by 22 per cent mainly driven by the higher claims experienced in our health portfolio. Across all lines of businesses, we continue to build necessary actuarial reserves to ensure we have a strong balance sheet.”
