He noted that the Oyetola led administration will not relent in making Osun a designation for sustainable investment. “As part of the efforts of Mr Governor is constitution of a committee of professionals who are working on how the polluted river would be cleansed,” he said. “Similarly, the MIREMCO is working round the clock in monitoring and control the activities of the artisanal miners both substantive and mechanical artisanal. “Governor Oyetola is also making efforts with various stakeholders in order to conduct mining in an organised manner while the government is also encouraging the miners to conduct their mining in environmental friendly manner.” He said further that the entire Committee would be paying a surprise visit to the miners as part of their readiness to address their menace in the state.
