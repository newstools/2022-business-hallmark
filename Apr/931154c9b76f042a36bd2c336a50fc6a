The group took the forms for Nwajuiba on Wednesday at the party’s headquarters in Abuja. Abubakar Usman, special assistant on new media to senate president, who Ahmad Lawan, disclosed this in a tweet on Wednesday, said the presidential hopeful is the first to get the ruling party’s presidential forms. “The Minister of State for Education, Hon.
