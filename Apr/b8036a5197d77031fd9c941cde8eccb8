Nigeria’s former vice president, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has told the national leadership of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to give him the right of first refusal for the party’s 2023 presidential ticket. Atiku who was candidate of the party in 2019, made the request when he met the PDP National Working Committee (NWC) led by the national chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, at the national secretariat in Abuja on Thursday to formally apprise it of his decision to seek the ticket in the next year’s presidential election.
